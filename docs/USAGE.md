# How to Use ZeroLimit
## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
- Download `ZeroLimit_x.x.x_x64-setup` from Releases
- Run the installer
- Launch ZeroLimit from Start Menu

### 2. First Launch - Onboarding

On first launch, you'll be guided through a setup wizard to configure CLIProxyAPI. You can choose between two setup modes:

---

#### Option A: Auto Download (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started. ZeroLimit will automatically download and configure the CLI Proxy for you.

1. Click **Get Started** on the welcome screen
2. Select **Auto Download**
3. Choose your version:
   - **Standard** — The original CLI Proxy API
   - **Plus** — Enhanced version with GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and Cursor support
4. ZeroLimit will download and extract the correct binary for your OS
5. Set a **Management Key** — this is the secret key used to protect the management API
6. Click **Finish Setup** — the proxy starts automatically and you're logged in

> [!TIP]
> The Auto Download mode handles everything: downloading the binary, writing the `config.yaml`, starting the server, and logging you in — all in one flow.

---

#### Option B: Manual Setup

If you already have CLIProxyAPI downloaded or prefer to manage it yourself:

1. Click **Get Started** on the welcome screen
2. Select **Manual Location**
3. Browse and select your `cli-proxy-api.exe` (or `cli-proxy-api-plus.exe`)
4. Set a **Management Key**
5. Click **Finish Setup**



> [!NOTE]
> For the Plus version with Kiro, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor support, download from CLIProxyAPI Plus Releases.
> Note: the upstream Plus repository has been deleted, so no new Plus releases exist — keep your existing Plus binary and the in-app update check cannot fetch Plus updates.
> For the Standard version, download from [CLIProxyAPI Releases](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/releases).

### Tracking Cursor usage

Cursor requires the Plus binary. Add it from the **Providers** page like any other provider (Cursor uses the proxy's `cursor-login` OAuth flow), then its plan usage appears on the **Quota** page alongside your other accounts.

---

#### Option C: Remote Server

If you're connecting to a remote HTTPS server, click **Skip For Now** during onboarding and log in manually:

1. Enter your **API Base URL** (e.g., `https://llm.yourdomain.com`)
2. Enter the **Management Key** from your server's `config.yaml`
3. Check **Remember credentials** to save for next time
4. Click **Login**

### Proxy Won't Start (Local)

- Try running as Administrator

- GitHub API may be rate-limited — try again in a few minutes
- Fall back to Manual Setup and download the binary yourself

### Connection Failed
- Ensure CLI Proxy is running (green status for local)
- Check the API Base URL is correct
- For HTTPS: verify the SSL certificate is valid
- Verify no firewall is blocking the port

### Login Failed
- In your CLIProxyAPI folder, rename `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
- Open `config.yaml` and find the `secret-key` value
- Use this key as your Management Key in ZeroLimit
